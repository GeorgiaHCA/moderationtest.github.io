# Moderating with AutSPACEs

Thank you for your interest in becoming a moderator for AutSPACEs. This is a hugely important and valuable role. As a moderator you will have a direct impact on the experiences of people using the AutSPACEs platform. You can help ensure that AutSPACEs is a welcoming and inclusive space where autistic people can be heard. 

## What to expect as an AutSPACEs moderator

As a moderator, your role will be to read experiences which people using the AutSPACEs platform have chosen to share publicly. You will then use the AutSPACEs Code of Conduct to assess whether each story is suitable for publication on AutSPACEs. 

## Benefits of moderating 

### Helping the autism community 

Moderation is absolutely essential to creating a welcoming and inclusive space for autistic people and their supporters online. Unfortunately, autistic people are more likely to encounter problems such as bullying and harassment online which may make their experience negative or prevent them from benefiting from online communities. At AutSPACEs we want to change that by creating a friendly, safe, autistic-voice-first space which diverse autistic people can trust. As a moderator, you can support other autistic people and their allies by making sure that when they come to AutSPACEs they are protected and can feel comfortable sharing their experiences. 

### Having power

As an AutSPACEs moderator, you have a direct say in what gets published. You can also influence the way the platform is run and the values that it upholds. We want you to have power and control over AutSPACEs, because it is your space and exists to support you. If you are frustrated about how autistic people are treated or spoken about online, by becoming an AutSPACEs moderator you can take direct action to change that and create a different space.

### Gaining skills 

Moderation skills are hugely valuable. As a moderator for AutSPACEs you will gain specific skills and understanding about what to look for when you moderate online posts, and how to assess them using a code of conduct. Reading others’ experiences will also broaden your perspective and you will be able to develop your empathy and awareness. 

### Flexibility 

As a moderator, the amount of time you want to put in is up to you. You will not be required to moderate for any set number of hours, and you can stop at any time if you do not wish to continue. It is an entirely flexible volunteering role which you can do from the comfort of your own home. 

## Risks of moderating 

As an AutSPACEs moderator, you will be in a position to shield others from potentially upsetting, triggering, explicit or abusive content. This means you will have to be prepared to read that content. Please therefore only apply to become an AutSPACEs moderator if you are psychologically robust and prepared to encounter such content. 

If you find that you are distressed, concerned, or negatively affected in any way by your experiences as a moderator, please reach out to a member of the moderator team [Bastian?, Georgia?] and we will support you.  

## How to moderate: step by step

* Apply to become a moderator [we need to determine this process]
* Complete moderator onboarding [this also needs to be determined]
* Create a moderator account on AutSPACEs * Log in to AutSPACEs using your moderator account and click on the “moderate” tab at the top menu bar to view stories you can moderate. Here you will see a list of experiences which you can moderate. 
* You will get a snippet view of each experience at first. If it isn’t something you want to read more of or look at, do not expand the snippet view. It will be passed on to another moderator to look at after 24 hours.
* You can moderate as many or as few experiences as you like, and spend as much or as little time moderating as you want to.  * It is vital that when you moderate you use the Code of Conduct to make your decisions. The Code of Conduct has been developed by an autism community to serve an autism community. Following the Code of Conduct is the fairest way of moderating. This is because by following the Code of Conduct, we can make sure that all users of the platform are treated the same, know what to expect, and can understand why decisions have been made. 
* For each experience you moderate, you have four assessment options based on a “traffic lights” system:
> - Green: the experience follows the AutSPACEs code of conduct and there is no or minimal risk to readers. If you choose this option, the person who shared it will be notified and the experience will be published on the AutSPACEs platform and will be available for anyone to read who comes to the platform. 
> - Amber: the experience follows the AutSPACEs code of conduct, and there is some potential risk to readers. For example, it might include upsetting or triggering content. [Whenever you give an amber rating, you will be prompted to add some keywords to explain the nature of the distressing content, for instance, “bullying”, “anorexia”, “self-harm”.]  If you choose this option, the person who shared it will be notified and the experience will be published on the AutSPACEs platform in a hidden view with a trigger warning. Readers will be able to make their own judgement about whether they want to read the story. It will not appear in searches where users have opted not to view potentially triggering content. 
> - Red: the experience does not follow the code of conduct. You will be asked for the part of the code of conduct which the experience does not follow. You should try to copy the code of conduct as closely as possible (e.g. “wording discriminates against disability”). This is so that the response is as objective and impersonal as possible, so that the reason is clear and the user does not feel personally attacked. The user will be notified, and the experience will not be published on the AutSPACEs platform. [It will still be available to the user to make changes and resubmit if they wish].
> - You may also flag the experience for another moderator to look at if you are unsure what assessment to make or if you would like another view. 
When you assess an experience as a moderator, the person who shared the story will be notified that a decision has been made and what the decision is, but you will be completely anonymous, and they will not know that you have made the decision. They will not be able to contact you directly, but they may contact the project team if they wish.
* Once an experience has been given to you to moderate, you have 24 hours to make an assessment decision. After 24 hours, the story will be passed on to another moderator to look at. Do not feel any pressure to keep to this timeframe. The 24 hour window is just to make sure that someone is able to look at the experience and the user who entered it is not waiting. 
* If, while moderating, you have any suggestions about the code of conduct or moderation process please let us know by sharing your feedback using the Google Form link on the moderation page. The Code of Conduct is a “living document” which you can influence if you want the platform to be moderated differently.
