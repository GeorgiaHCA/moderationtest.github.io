# Code of Conduct

## Introduction 
The AutSPACEs platform is an online space which puts autistic people first. 
We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming place for autistic people and their supporters to share experiences, knowing their voices will be heard and their contributions recognised.
AutSPACEs allows users to share stories publicly with other users as well as privately with researchers. 
In order for the platform to be a respectful and welcoming place for autistic people and other members of the community, everyone sharing a story publicly will be required to follow this code of conduct. Before they are published all stories will be reviewed by a moderator who will use this document as guidance when making decisions as to whether a post can be approved or not. 
This code of conduct exists for clarity and fairness, as well as to ensure the values of AutSPACEs are upheld. 
It was co-written by autistic people, the parents and carers of autistic people, and researchers with expertise in creating inclusive online spaces.
The lead investigator of AutSPACEs - [] - is responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct and overseeing the moderation process. 
They can be contacted by emailing []. Reports may be reviewed by other members of the research team, unless there is a conflict of interest, and will be kept confidential.

## What the platform is and isn't for 
The primary purpose of the platform is to gather data about sensory processing and navigating environments in order to make the world more accessible to autistic people. In order for a story to be approved by moderators it must be relevant to this. This doesn’t mean you can’t write about other things, as long as they relate to sensory experiences. The data we are collecting is also for a specific demographic: all stories must be about experiences of someone who is over the age of 18 at the time of posting. Entries about the past before the user was 18 are permitted. For instance, an 18 year old could post about an experience they had when they were 10, but a 10 year-old would not be permitted to post.
As this is a data collection platform, users will have the option to share their stories with both researchers and/or the public. Further information about how stories will be used by researchers is available [insert link]. Only stories posted to the public will be moderated, all information below.
As much as we would like to be able to help everyone with everything, that is unfortunately out of the scope of this project. AutSPACEs cannot offer professional support, however, we can link you to appropriate sources if necessary. 
 
## What is considered to be sensory

People with autism often have sensory differences. This means their senses may be weaker or stronger than those who are neurotypical. This is why navigating and coping in the world can be very difficult for people with autism.
There are seven senses:
Sight
Hearing
Smell
Taste
Touch
Balance (Vestibular)
Body Awareness (Proprioception)

## What is and isn't acceptable to be mentioned in stories

AutSPACEs is designed to be a welcoming and safe place for all people with autism to share and read experiences. In order to ensure this we have created a Red and Amber list of words and topics that may be offensive or triggering to some users. 
The purpose of having the Red category is to make sure we don’t publish experiences which contravene our values of mutual respect, diversity, and inclusion, or which cause a risk to the person who posts the experience or others. Examples of content marked Red would be direct or indirect attacks on people for being autistic, referring to autism as a dysfunction, using an offensive or prejudicial term to describe someone. Explicitly including someone’s identity or sensitive data is sticlty forbidden, examples of sensitive data are listed below. 
A person’s first name and/or surname
Someone’s contact details including:  address, phone number, school, email address or place of work
Anything that could distinguish that person from others (ie, hair colour or skin tone)

 
The purpose of having the Amber list is to help users identify posts that may find triggering or distressing before they read them, to avoid harm to users of AutSPACEs. While some people may be sensitive to them, it is important that these experiences are available, and that users are free to express themselves. Examples of content marked Amber might be an account of bullying, a traumatic home environment, or descriptions of verbal abuse which a user has experienced. 
Stories that include Red content will automatically be disapproved. Those regarded as Amber will be approved but may be labelled as ‘triggering’ when posted on the platform. 
Any post which discriminates or belittles anyone based on the below categories will be regarded as Red. 
* Neurodiversity
* Gender Identity and/or Expression
* Sexual Orientation
* Disability and/or Health
* Physical Appearance (eg. skin colour, body size, etc.)
* Nationality, Citizenship and Ethnic or Social Origin
* Religion/Belief (or lack thereof)
* Pregnancy and/or Familial Status
* Veteran Status
* Genetic Information
* Property and/or Socio-Economic Status
* Technical Preferences
* Experience Level

 
All racial slurs [insert link to external list of racial slurs] will automatically be considered Red whether they are direct or indirect comments. Swear words and disability slurs will be rated Amber.
Below is a list of topics that may be triggering to some users. All stories that refer to these topics will be listed as Amber.
Abuse (physical, sexual, emotional and verbal)
Violence and Assault
Drug and/or Alcohol use
Mental Health Issues
Negative body image

 
## Additional guidelines for writing on behalf of others

While AutSPACEs exists as a platform where autistic people can share their own stories, we are aware that there will be some cases where autistic people will need support to use the platform or require others may share experiences on their behalf. All of the above rules above are still in place when posting on behalf of others, and anything which breaks them will be automatically disapproved for publication on the AutSPACEs platform.
These are a series of questions to prompt you to think about how you can best share a story that is not your own, in order to make sure the story is respectful, appropriate, and representative. 
Can the person who you are writing about share their own story with support? 

If so, please support them to share their own experience, rather than writing about their experience yourself on their behalf. For instance, if they can speak but not write, it is better to allow them to dictate, and try to write what they are saying as accurately as possible, than to write your own version of their story. It is also a good idea to show what you wish to share to the person who you are writing on behalf of. If you can, try to find out if this reflects their experience and if you can change it to make it better. 
Have they consented to you writing on their behalf?

If so, that’s great. If not, please seek their consent. 
If they do not give their consent, do not share their story, even if you think it would benefit them if it is shared. If they are not able to meaningfully consent, then please share only if you think that it is in their best interests to do so. 
Are you the right person to share this story? 

If there is someone else who has a closer personal connection to the person whose story you would like to be shared on the platform, or who is better qualified to so, consider asking them to share the story instead. You may also wish to share your version of the story with others who know the person well to make it more accurate.
Are you making any assumptions or inferences about the autistic person you are sharing on behalf of?

It is very natural to think we know what is going on in other people’s minds, and sometimes we can talk about this as a fact without even noticing we are doing so. These are not facts but inferences. It is better to stick to telling us what you observed about the autistic person you are writing on behalf of rather than making assumptions about what they think or feel. 
>E.g. don’t write, “my autistic son was stressed because the train was loud’, 
>Please write, ‘My autistic son shouted and covered his ears when a train passed him loudly. This happens frequently.’’ 

The aim of entering on behalf of others should be in the service of autistic people’s wellbeing. 
If you need more support as a carer or parent, we recommend these resources: [link to resources?]
Are you adding subjective and personal details which are your own? 
It is better to write neutrally about the things you are observing. 
Focus on the experience of the autistic person you are writing on behalf of. Don’t focus on your own experiences or the experiences of other people, except when it is relevant to the autistic person’s experience. In particular, do not use this space for venting or complaining about autistic people.   
>E.g. don’t write, “I hate it when my autistic son makes a scene in the supermarket, it’s so embarrassing”, 
>Please write, “my autistic son cried and stood still in a busy supermarket. Some people around us showed negative expressions and body language while this happened. This usually  occurs when we go to the supermarket.” 

## Responding to others' stories
AutSPACEs is designed to be a safe space where people can post their experiences without the fear of receiving negative or upsetting responses. In order to maintain this safety there is no comment section on the site. Any stories posted as a direct response to another post will be disapproved. 
However, as AutSPACEs is an anonymous platform, it is permissible to discuss stories on other sites. 

## Consequences for disapproved posts 
If you post a story that the moderators believe goes against this Code of Conduct it will be disapproved. 
You will have the opportunity to edit and resubmit the story. Each time someone posts a story that is disapproved they will receive a warning. 
We appreciate that not everyone thinks or communicates in the same way, which is why this guide has been written. 
Each case will be viewed individually and if you are unsure why a story was disapproved you contact us for an explanation.
